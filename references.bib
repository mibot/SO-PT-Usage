I will consider the question of whether the dominant role of English as a lingua franca (ELF) is a menace to other languages, to multilingual communication and to the profession of translation and interpreting, or whether a positive evaluation of the omnipresence of English as a default means of communication can be justified. I will argue for a compromise position: neither demonizing global English nor welcoming it uncritically. I will support this stance from different perspectives, drawing on my own work on ELF and translation.",

@article{Wang2013,
    abstract = {StackOverflow provides a popular platform where developers post and answer questions. Recently, Treude et al. manually label 385 questions in StackOverflow and group them into 10 categories based on their contents. They also analyze how tags are used in StackOverflow. In this study, we extend their work to obtain a deeper understanding on how developers interact with one another on such a question and answer web site. First, we analyze the distributions of developers who ask and answer questions. We also investigate if there is a segregation of the StackOverflow community into questioners and answerers. We also perform automated text mining to find the various kinds of topics asked by developers. We use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a well known topic modeling approach, to analyze the contents of tens of thousands of questions and answers, and produce five topics. Our topic modeling strategy provides an alternative perspective different from that of Treude et al. for categorizing StackOverflow questions. Each question can now be categorized into several topics with different probabilities, and the learned topic model could automatically assign a new question to several categories with varying probabilities. Last but not least, we show the distributions of questions and developers belonging to various topics generated by LDA. Copyright 2013 ACM.},

The main objective of the study is to understand how satisfied users are with various aspects of the StackOverflow forum and how effective it is as a learning platform. The results reveal that StackOverflow may not support the learning needs of new learners. The specificity also discourages many users from frequently interacting on the forum.},

We analyzed the SO data from four perspectives to understand the dynamics of reputation building on SO. The results of our analysis provide guidance to new SO contributors who want to earn high reputation scores quickly. In particular, the results indicate that the following activities can help to build reputation quickly: answering questions related to tags with lower expertise density, answering questions promptly, being the first one to answer a question, being active during off peak hours, and contributing to diverse areas.},
