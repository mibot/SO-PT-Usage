\section{Results}
We could only identify the location of 7.264 users of SOPT which corresponds to 27\% of its users using \texttt{countryNameManager}\footnote{https://github.com/tue-mdse/countryNameManager}. As we foresaw, most of the users of SOPT are located at Portuguese-speaking countries, in particular in Brazil (see Table \ref{tbl:Locations}). Although there is a wide range of non-Portuguese speaking countries users, when looking at percentages these countries only represent 2%. 

\begin{table}[ht]

United Kingdom      & 80 \\
Canada				& 44 \\
France              & 25 \\
Germany				& 42 \\
India				& 30 \\
The Netherlands		& 20 \\
Mozambique*		    & 14 \\
Angola*		 		& 8 \\
Cape Verde*		    & 4 \\

\end{table}

For half of the users whose location was identified, we could identify their gender (65\%). Females are an overwhelming minority (4\% SOPT users).


\as{Explain why do you want to analyze these URLs?}

Next, we have worked on WebSiteUrl field of users table\as{This is the first time the ``users table'' is mentioned. Where does it come from?}\as{Please typeset ``users'' in the same way as countryNameManager above.} to verify if they have an owner website\as{What do you mean by ``an owner website''? Developers do not own GitHub...} recorded. Indeed, We found 143 users with GitHub URL, 2.775 users with others URL and 3.036 users no URL. Consequently, we have verified \as{What do you mean by ``verified'' here? What exactly did you verify?} each user on (SO) profile, in some cases their websites and GitHub profiles comparing user name, picture, location and other relevant data such as programming languages, tags, and other communities where they are joined in order to obtain an email address. \as{I cannot understand this sentence, please rewrite.}
