\section{Results}
\subsection{\mb{SO-PT Users}}
We identify the location of 7.264 users of SOPT which corresponds to 27\% of its users. As we foresaw, most of the users of SOPT are located at Portuguese-speaking countries, in particular in Brazil (see Table \ref{tbl:Locations}). Although there is a wide range of non-Portuguese speaking countries users, when looking at percentages these countries only represent 2%.

\end{table}

For half of the users whose location was identified, we could identify their gender (65\%). Females are an overwhelming minority (4\% SOPT users).

\subsection{Survey}
A total of 215 Brazilian users from the 1050 responded to the survey during the time it was online. This result is significant because of the difficulty normally involved in obtaining such a large quantity of individuals suitable for making up a target population. 

\subsubsection{Background}
The majority of the respondents (92\%) are ICT professionals, and only 8\% have other professions such as students and academics. The ICT role most frequently played by the participants is that of software engineer/developer/system or database administrator (83\%), and data scientist/machine learning developer/statistics or maths developer (3\%). The remaining roles (technical coordinator, electronics technician, head of software development, web designer, software architect, etc.) are performed by less than 6\% each. This means that ICT professionals use SO to ask/answer issues related to their sotware development activities.

We asked the respondents about mother tongue, writing and reading skills in both Portuguese and English, and language used in their daily activities. In the first question, the mother tongue of the respondents is Portuguese (99\%), and the remaining 1\% is Finnish. This result is consistent due to the official language in Brazil is the Portuguese. In the part related to writing and reading Portuguese skills, the majority of them have excellent (native) level (95\%), and the remaining 5\% have an advanced level. This is due to as we told above about the language used in Brazil. In the same way about writing and reading English skills. The level most frequently played by the participants is that of advanced (59\%), followed by intermediate (43\%), excellent (native) 13\%, and survival (level) 9\%. These results are due to most of them use English in their software development activities such as coding, debugging, etc. Finally, the part related to the language used in daily activities, Portuguese is used in their homes (84\%) and 87\% at streets, banks, post offices, etc., and Portuguese and English are used at work (62\%) and school (65\%). 

\subsubsection{Stack Overflow in Portuguese (SO-PT)}
The majority of the respondents (38\%) are users with between 1 and 2 years as members of SO-PT, followed by 33\% with less than 1 year, and 29\% with more than 3 years. This results have sense due to SO-PT was lauched in 2013 and most of its users are from SO-EN.
  
We asked the respondents about their contributions and the frequency, the contribution types asked them were: creating questions, commenting on questions, answering questions, commenting on answers, editing questions and/or answers, voting up/down in questions and/or answers. The roles most frequently played by the participants are that of both never and almost never (about once a year) in all, followed by rarely (not more than once a month) and ocassionally (about once a week); and frequently (almost) was less chose. These results reported that SO-PT users do not use the Stack Overflow in Portuguese for these types of contributions (for more details see table \ref{tbl:contributions_SO-PT}).

\subsubsection{Stack Overflow in Portuguese (SO-EN)}
The majority of the respondents (40\%) are users with between 4 and 6 years as members of SO-EN, followed by 29\% with more than 6 years, and 13\% with less than 1 year. The remaining 18\% corresponds to some people did not answer all the questions (because of some conditional questions)
