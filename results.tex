\section{Results}
We could only identify the location of 7.264 users of SOPT which corresponds to 27\% of its users. As we foresaw, most of the users of SOPT are located at Portuguese-speaking countries, in particular in Brazil (see Table \ref{tbl:Locations}). Although there is a wide range of non-Portuguese speaking countries users, when looking at percentages these countries only represent 2%.

For half of the users whose location was identified, we could identify their gender (65\%). Females are an overwhelming minority (4\% SOPT users).
